# Example: GitLab CI with Child Pipeline for Complete Isolation
#
# This approach uses GitLab's child pipelines feature to run AI reviews
# in a completely separate pipeline that doesn't affect your main workflow at all.
#
# Benefits:
# - AI review pipeline is completely isolated
# - Main pipeline is never blocked or delayed
# - Review results appear as separate pipeline in MR
# - Better for resource-constrained runners

stages:
  - trigger    # Trigger child pipeline
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

# =============================================================================
# Trigger AI Review Child Pipeline (doesn't block main pipeline)
# =============================================================================

trigger_ai_review:
  stage: trigger
  trigger:
    include:
      - local: .gitlab-ci-review.yml
    strategy: depend  # Use 'depend' to fail if review fails, or remove to ignore
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
  # This job just triggers the child pipeline and returns immediately

# =============================================================================
# Your main pipeline (runs independently)
# =============================================================================

test:
  stage: test
  image: node:20
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test
  # Runs immediately without waiting for AI review

build:
  stage: build
  image: node:20
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
  needs: ["test"]

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:latest
  script:
    - echo "Deploying..."
  needs: ["build"]
  only:
    - main
